The **Weather App** is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to view current weather conditions for any city. The app features a simple and user-friendly interface where users can enter a city name, and it will display relevant weather information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy). 

With the help of JavaScript, the app fetches real-time data from a weather API, updating the display dynamically based on the user's input. The design is responsive, thanks to CSS, ensuring the app looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. This combination of technologies provides an interactive, visually appealing, and functional weather tool for users.
